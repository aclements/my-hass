# The control panel consumes about 2.8W.
#
# When the washer is running, it frequently drops to 7.5W, but this
# never lasts more than 10 seconds. The max over 60 seconds never
# drops below 50W, except right at the beginning when it starts at
# 10â€“20W and ramps up for ~20 seconds. In that ramp up, it sometime
# briefly drops below 7.5W, but since this happens in the first 20
# seconds, we're still in the window where transitioning back to "off"
# is disallowed.
#
# When the washer finishes, it drops to <1W for about 10 seconds, then
# 0W.
#
# For any transition, to prevent flapping and smooth blips that happen
# just after a transition, we disallow another transition for
# WINDOW_DUR (longer would also be safe).
